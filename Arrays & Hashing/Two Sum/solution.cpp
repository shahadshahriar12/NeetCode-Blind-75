/* Algorithm Used
The solution implements the Hash Map (Hash Table) approach for the Two Sum problem. Here's how it works:

Initialize: Create a hash map (map<int, int> sumMap) to store numbers and their indices
Iterate: For each element in the array:
Calculate the complement: target - nums[i]
Check if the complement exists in the hash map
If complement is not found: Store the current number and its index in the hash map
If complement is found: Return the indices of the complement and current element
Return: The function returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target

Time Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm makes a single pass through the array of n elements
For each element, it performs:
Hash map lookup: O(1) average case
Hash map insertion: O(1) average case
Total: O(n) Ã— O(1) = O(n)

Space Complexity Analysis
Space Complexity: O(n)

In the worst case, the hash map stores all n elements before finding the solution
This happens when the target pair is the last element and one other element
The solution vector uses O(1) space (always stores exactly 2 elements)
Total auxiliary space: O(n) + O(1) = O(n)
